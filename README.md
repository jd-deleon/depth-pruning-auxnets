# Depth Pruning with Auxiliary Networks for tinyML

This repository contains training scripts and implementations used in the paper: Depth Pruning with Auxiliary Networks for tinyML. This work will be presented in the upcoming International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing 2022 (ICASSP 2022).

The repository is a work in progress and only contains code for training the baseline models for now. It will be updated with the pruning code as the conference date comes closer.
